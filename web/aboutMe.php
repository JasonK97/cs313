            My name is Jason Kent, I'm a Software Engineering Major, I'm a Junior, and I'm getting 
            married in April! I love playing Guitar and Soccer, and I enjoy playing videogames with 
            my friends in my free time (Currently Siege and MW mostly). I'm from just north of Seattle, 
            Washington, born and raised. I like the snow, but I hate the wind, so Rexburg is a win/lose.
